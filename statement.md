# Project Statement: Spam SMS Detection

# Problem Statement
Spam messages are a growing cybersecurity concern, often used for phishing, scams, and spreading malicious links. Manual detection is unreliable and time‑consuming, while traditional filters may fail against evolving spam techniques.  
This project aims to build a lightweight machine learning model that can automatically classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam), improving communication safety and reducing the risk of fraud.
# Scope of Project
- Focused on SMS text classification using machine learning.  
- Uses the SMS Spam Collection dataset. 
- Applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing.  
- Trains and evaluates a Naive Bayes classifier for fast and accurate spam detection.  
- Provides evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix).  
- Scope is limited to SMS messages in English; multilingual support and advanced deep learning models are considered future extensions

## High‑Level Features
- Spam vs Ham Classification– Detects whether an SMS is spam or legitimate.  
- Text Preprocessing– Cleans and converts raw SMS into numerical features using TF‑IDF.  
- Lightweight Model – Naive Bayes ensures fast training and prediction.  
- High Accuracy– Achieves ~95% accuracy on test data.  
- Custom Testing– Users can input their own SMS messages for classification.  
- Evaluation Metrics– Provides detailed performance reports for transparency. 
## Target Audience
- Students & Researchers– Learning applications of AI/ML in cybersecurity.  
- Telecom Providers – Integrating spam detection into SMS gateways.  
- Cybersecurity Enthusiasts – Exploring lightweight models for fraud prevention.  
- General Users – Understanding how AI can protect them from spam and phishing attempts.
